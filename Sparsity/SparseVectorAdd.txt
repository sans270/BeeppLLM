Write a python program that gets a total number of entries and two sparsity ratios from the user. 
It then creates two sparse vectors using the sparsity ratios and the total number of entries. It prints both the sparse vectors. 
Finally, it adds the two sparse vector into a added vector and prints the added vector.
