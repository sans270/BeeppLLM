Write a python program that creates two sparse vectors by getting a total number of entries and two sparsity ratios from the user, 
and then generating random numbers for the sparse vectors and random positions for the numbers in the sparse vectors, and it prints the two sparse vectors and the positions.
It then subtracts the two sparse vectors and prints the subracted vector and the positions of the subtracted vector.
